**Dr. Derry Wijaya**
Associate Professor of Data Science

Derry conducts research in natural language processing (NLP), with a focus on machine learning and deep learning applications in multilingual NLP. Her studies include machine translation (MT), which demonstrates how to leverage well-annotated languages to improve the translation of less-annotated ones and how images, related tasks, and data augmentation can be used to improve the representation and translation of languages with little training data. Derry also studies methods for automatically learning the meanings of verbs and extracting information for knowledge base population through analysis of diverse information sources.
Through interdisciplinary collaborations, Derry has conducted research on the applications of NLP to computational news framing and public health, in detecting and analysing how articles in traditional and emerging media on various public affairs or public health issues are written and framed. Derry has also conducted research on analysing bias and misinformation, within AI models and in public communications. Derry has a Postdoc from University of Pennsylvania and a PhD from Carnegie Mellon University. She received her Bachelor and Masterâ€™s Degrees in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore.
