Who We Are?
======

We are a multidisciplinary team of researchers working at the intersection of communities, digital technology, and social innovation. We address the challenge of sustainability and inclusion in digital technology. We are part of the research group of Monash Global's Action Lab Network (Monash University Australia, Monash University Malaysia and Monash University Indonesia). We collaborate with external partners (industry, academia and government) to develop projects with sustainable impact. We act as a research capacity for organisations by aligning our core values and collaborating with them to create tangible, meaningful solutions.

Our Project

The project will lay the groundwork for an organized effort to digitize numerous unlabeled resources to enable the training of language models and technologies for these languages, which in turn will promote multilingualism and linguistic diversity. In collaboration with the Vision and Language Group (Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence with Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Australia), researchers will collect and build a large and diverse collection of Indonesian (digital) language data in text, speech, and image form, and train language models on these data.

This project aims to help fintech credit institutions improve their credit risk modelling. The results of our research could positively impact marginalised consumers' access to credit and enable lenders to contribute to their livelihoods. This project explores the critical role of sociodemographic characteristics, economic conditions, technological opportunities, and network effects on financial inclusion. Understanding these factors could help fintech lending institutions develop their service and reduce the financial gap through technological implementation.
