Who We Are?
======

We are a multidisciplinary team of researchers working at the intersection of communities, digital technology, and social innovation. We address the challenge of sustainability and inclusion in digital technology. We collaborate with external partners (industry, academia, and government) to develop projects with sustainable impact. We act as a research capacity for organisations by aligning our core values and collaborating with them to create tangible, meaningful solutions.
